**Standard and simple answer**

>
> The new Fiber architecture uses linked lists, which can implement time slicing and prevent JS calculations from taking up too much time and causing browsing problems.

React v15 and the previous architecture are called Stack architecture. Starting from v16, React has reconstructed the overall architecture. The new architecture is called Fiber architecture. Compared with the old architecture, the biggest feature of the new architecture is that it can achieve time slice.

## Problems with old architecture

> React is the preferred way to build large, responsive web applications with JavaScript

What are the situations that cause our web application to not respond quickly?

To sum up, there are actually two major types of scenarios that limit quick response:

- When you need to perform a lot of calculations or the performance of the device itself is insufficient, the page will experience frame drops and freezes. This is essentially caused by the bottleneck of the CPU.
- When performing I/O, you need to wait for the data to be returned before performing subsequent operations. During the waiting process, you cannot respond quickly. This situation actually comes from the bottleneck of I/O.

### CPU bottleneck

When we usually browse the web, the web page is actually drawn by the browser, just like a painter drawing.

![React-overall-architecture-1](../../../public/static/images/React/React-overall-architecture/React-overall-architecture-1.jpg)

The web pages we usually browse often have some moving things in them, such as carousels, blinds, etc. The essence is that the browser is constantly drawing.

Currently, the refresh rate of most devices is 60 FPS, which means that it needs to be drawn 60 times in 1 second, 1000ms / 60 = 16.66ms, which means that the browser needs to draw a frame every 16.66ms.

When the browser draws a frame, it actually has a lot of things to do:

![React-overall-architecture-2](../../../public/static/images/React/React-overall-architecture/React-overall-architecture-2.png)

The tasks in the picture above are called "rendering pipelines". Every time the pipeline is executed, it generally requires the above steps, but it does not mean that all tasks need to be executed every time:

- When the geometric properties (such as length, width) of DOM elements are modified through JS or CSS, the complete rendering pipeline will be triggered. This situation is called reflow (reflow)
- When the modified properties do not involve geometric properties (such as fonts, colors), the Layout and Layer processes in the pipeline will be omitted. This situation is called redrawing.
- When modifying "properties that do not involve rearrangement or redrawing (such as the transform attribute)", the Layout, Layer, and Print processes in the pipeline will be omitted, and only the drawing work of the composition thread will be performed. This situation is called composition.

Sort by performance: Composition > Redraw > Reflow

As mentioned before, the browser drawing frequency is 16.66ms per frame, but executing JS and the rendering pipeline are actually executed on the same thread, which means that if the execution time of JS is too long, the next page cannot be rendered in time. Frame, which means that the page is dropped, and the manifested phenomenon is that the page is stuck.

This problem existed before Reactv16, where JS code took too long to execute. In React, it is necessary to calculate the entire virtual DOM tree. Although it is calculated at the JS level, it saves a lot of time compared to directly operating the DOM. However, recalculating the entire virtual DOM tree every time will cause the error of each frame. The execution time of JS code is too long, resulting in animations and some real-time updates not receiving timely responses, resulting in stuck visual effects.

Suppose we have the following DOM hierarchy:

![React-overall-architecture-3](../../../public/static/images/React/React-overall-architecture/React-overall-architecture-3.png)

Then the structure converted into a virtual DOM object is roughly as follows:

```js
{
   type: "div",
   props : {
     id: "test",
     children : [
       {
         type: "h1",
         props : {
           children : "This is a title"
         }
       }
       {
         type: "p",
         props : {
           children : "This is a paragraph"
         }
       },{
         type: "ul",
         props : {
           children : [{
             type: "li",
             props : {
               children : "apple"
             }
           },{
             type: "li",
             props : {
               children : "banana"
             }
           },{
             type: "li",
             props : {
               children : "pear"
             }
           }]
         }
       }
     ]
   }
}
```

Before the React v16 version, when comparing two virtual DOM trees, it was necessary to traverse the above structure. At this time, only recursion could be used, and this recursion could not be interrupted. One road would go to black, thus This causes JS execution time to be too long.

![React-overall-architecture-4](../../../public/static/images/React/React-overall-architecture/React-overall-architecture-4.png)

This architecture model is officially called the Stack architecture model, because it uses recursion and will constantly open new function stacks.

### I/O bottleneck

For front-end development, the main I/O bottleneck is network latency.

Network delay is an objective phenomenon, so how to reduce the impact of this phenomenon on users? The answer given by the React team is: to integrate the research results of human-computer interaction into the UI.

Users' perception of lag is different. Even if there is only a slight delay in the input box, the user will think it is very lag. Suppose it is loading a list, even if the loading takes several seconds, the user will not feel lag.

For React, all operations come from re-rendering caused by changes in independent variables. We only need to give different priorities to different operations.

Specifically, it mainly includes the following three points:

- Give different priorities to the "independent variable changes" caused by different operations
- All priorities are scheduled uniformly, and the "highest priority updates" are processed first
- If the update is in progress (entering virtual DOM-related work) and a "higher priority update" occurs at this time, the current update in the middle will be processed first.

To achieve the above three points, the underlying layer of React needs to be able to implement:

- Scheduler for scheduling priorities
- Scheduling algorithm corresponding to the scheduler
- Support the implementation of interruptible virtual DOM

So whether it is to solve the CPU bottleneck or the I/O bottleneck, the underlying requirement is to implement the Time Slice

## Solution ideas for new architecture

### Solving CPU bottlenecks

Starting from React v16, the official team officially quoted the concept of Fiber, which is a way to describe UI through linked lists. In essence, you can also regard it as an implementation of virtual DOM.

> Rather than thinking of "Virtual DOM" as a technology, it's more of a pattern, and people often mean different things when they refer to it. In the world of React, the term "Virtual DOM" is often associated with [React Elements](https://react.docschina.org/docs/rendering-elements.html) because they are objects that represent user interfaces . React also uses an internal object called "fibers" to store additional information about the component tree. The above two are also considered part of the "Virtual DOM" implementation in React.

Fiber is essentially an object, but the difference from the previous React elements is that the objects are connected in a linked list structure. child points to the child element, sibling points to the sibling element, and return points to the parent element.

As shown below:

![React-overall-architecture-5](../../../public/static/images/React/React-overall-architecture/React-overall-architecture-5.png)

One of the biggest advantages of using a linked list structure is that the process can be interrupted when reconciling the entire tree.

When it is found that one frame time is no longer enough, JS cannot continue to be executed and the next frame needs to be rendered, the execution of JS will be interrupted at this time and the next frame will be rendered first. After rendering is completed, come back and complete the JS calculations that were not completed last time.

![React-overall-architecture-6](../../../public/static/images/React/React-overall-architecture/React-overall-architecture-6.png)

The official also provides a comparison example between Stack architecture and Fiber architecture: https://claudiopro.github.io/react-fiber-vs-stack-demo/

The following is the relevant code to create Fiber objects in the React source code:

```js
const createFiber = function (tag, pendingProps, key, mode) {
  //Create an instance object of the fiber node
  return new FiberNode(tag, pendingProps, key, mode)
}

function FiberNode(tag, pendingProps, key, mode) {
  //Instance
  this.tag = tag
  this.key = key
  this.elementType = null
  this.type = null
  this.stateNode = null // Map the real DOM

  //Fiber
  // The upper, lower, and front fibers are related in the form of a linked list.
  this.return = null
  this.child = null
  this.sibling = null
  this.index = 0

  this.ref = null
  this.refCleanup = null
  //Related to hook
  this.pendingProps = pendingProps
  this.memoizedProps = null
  this.updateQueue = null
  this.memoizedState = null
  this.dependencies = null

  this.mode = mode

  // Effects
  this.flags = NoFlags
  this.subtreeFlags = NoFlags
  this.deletions = null

  this.lanes = NoLanes
  this.childLanes = NoLanes

  this.alternate = null
  // ...
}
```

### Solving I/O bottlenecks

Scheduler has been introduced since React v16, which is used to schedule the priority of tasks.

UI = f(state):

- Calculate UI based on changes in independent variables
- Execute specific host environment APIs based on UI changes

Before React v16:

- Reconciler: vdom implementation, calculating UI changes based on changes in independent variables
- Renderer: Responsible for rendering UI changes to the host environment

Starting from React v16, there is an additional component:

- Scheduler: the priority of scheduling tasks. High-priority tasks will enter the Reconciler first.
- Reconciler: vdom implementation, calculating UI changes based on changes in independent variables
- Renderer: Responsible for rendering UI changes to the host environment

In the new architecture, Reconciler's update process has also changed from the previous recursion to an "interruptible loop process."

```js
function workLoopConcurrent{
   // If there are still tasks and there is remaining time in the time slice
   while(workInProgress !== null && !shouldYield()){
     performUnitOfWork(workInProgress);
   }
}

function shouldYield(){
   // Is the current time greater than the expiration time?
   //where deadline = getCurrentTime() + yieldInterval
   // yieldInterval is the time interval preset by the scheduler, the default is 5ms
   return getCurrentTime() >= deadline;
}
```

Each loop will call shouldYield to determine whether the current time slice has enough remaining time. If there is not enough remaining time, the execution of the reconciler will be suspended, the main thread will be returned to the rendering pipeline, and the rendering operation of the next frame will be performed. The rendering work is completed. Then, wait for the next macro task to execute the subsequent code.

However, the difference from the previous solution is that each Fiber object is connected in series through a linked list. Point to child elements through child, point to sibling elements through sibling, and point to parent elements through return.

Each loop will call shouldYield to determine whether the current TimeSlice has remaining time. If there is no remaining time, the update process will be suspended, the main thread will be returned to the rendering pipeline, and the execution will continue until the next macro task. This solves the CPU bottleneck problem.
